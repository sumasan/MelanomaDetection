# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection Assignment
 
Aim:
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
 
## General Information

- What is the background of your project?
  This Upgrad assignment project, to apply CNN concept learnt. 

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.


 
## Conclusions

 
- Built Better fit CNN model for Melanoma Detection, after addressing issues like overfitting and underfitting in the given train dataset
 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
- IDE: Google Colab
